#Meeting Program
This is an 8.5" x 11" half-fold, brochure-style meeting program template. It includes a cover with an image, a page for announcements, a page for the meeting agenda, and a back cover. The example file, `main.pdf`, is for a fictional [LDS](https://www.lds.org) Sacrament meeting service but works equally well for any meeting needing a simple program.

The template references an image file `nelson.jpg` that is not included with the template. Replace `nelson.jpg` with the path and name of the cover image file you would like to use.

#Font Information
##Introduction
This template references two fonts: Minion Pro and Goudy Trajan. To use different fonts, change lines 25, 28, 47, and 48 of `main.tex`.

##[Minion Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro) (License required)
“Minion is an Adobe Originals typeface designed by Robert Slimbach. It was inspired by classical, old style typefaces of the late Renaissance, a period of elegant, beautiful, and highly readable type designs. Minion Pro exhibits the aesthetic and functional qualities that make text type highly readable, yet is also suitable for display settings.”

##[Goudy Trajan](http://www.castletype.com/html/tipoteca/goudy-trajan-trial.html) (Demo version available)
“Goudy Trajan is based on drawings by American type designer [F.W. Goudy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy) of his rendition of the capital letters inscribed on the [Trajan column](http://www.castletype.com/html/misc/goudy-trajan-column.html). The demo version of Goudy Trajan contains over 450 glyphs, including: uppercase, numerals, punctuation, and support for most European languages. (The Pro version contains almost 1500 glyphs, and includes support for Cyrillic and Greek.)

“This version is fully functional, but does not include discretionary ligatures, small caps, oldstyle numerals, alternates, Cyrillic, Greek, or fleurons. Note that the End-User License Agreement applies to both versions of the font.”
