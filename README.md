#LaTeX Templates
A repository of some LaTeX templates I use on a semi-regular basis.

##[Book](book/README.md)
Based roughly on the design of Robert Bringhurst’s “The Elements of Typographic Style.” I used it to create a small collection of family histories.

##[Meeting Program](meeting-program/README.md)
This is an 8.5" x 11" half-fold, brochure-style meeting program template. It includes a cover with an image, a page for announcements, a page for the meeting agenda, and a back cover.
